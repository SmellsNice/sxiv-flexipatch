 * Remember to uncomment the relevant lines in the Makefile when enabling this patch.

/*
 * With this patch when the window is mapped, some ICCCM WM_HINTS are set.
 * The input field is set to true and state is set to NormalState.
 *
 * To quote the spec, "The input field is used to communicate to the window
 * manager the input focus model used by the client" and "[c]lients with
 * the Passive and Locally Active models should set the input flag to
 * True". sxiv falls under the Passive Input model, since it expects keyboard
 * input, but only listens for key events on its single, top-level window instead
 * of subordinate windows (Locally Active) or the root window (Globally Active).
 *
 * From the end users prospective, all EWMH/ICCCM compliant WMs (especially
 * the minimalistic ones) will allow the user to focus sxiv, which will
 * allow sxiv to receive key events. If the input field is not set, WMs are
 * allowed to assume that sxiv doesn't require focus.
